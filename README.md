# 🧠 ReAct Agent from Scratch  
### A step-by-step implementation of a reasoning agent — no frameworks, just pure Python

---

> 🔍 **Observe. Think. Act. Repeat.**  
> This repository walks through building a **fully autonomous ReAct (Reason + Act) agent** from the ground up — using only Python and an LLM API.  
> No LangChain. No LlamaIndex. No magic. Just logic.

## 🌟 What Is This?

This is a hands-on project that teaches **how AI agents really work** by building one **from scratch**.

Most agents today are built using high-level frameworks that hide the internals.  
Here, you’ll see **every line of code**, understand **every decision**, and learn how to make an LLM:

🧠 **Reason** → 🛠️ **Use Tools** → 🔍 **Observe Results** → 🔄 **Continue Thinking** → ✅ **Give Final Answer**

This is the **ReAct framework** — and you're building it yourself.

## 🧩 What Is ReAct?

**ReAct = Reason + Act**

It’s a powerful pattern where an agent alternates between:
- **Thought**: “I need to find Earth’s mass”
- **Action**: Calls a tool like `get_planet_mass: Earth`
- **PAUSE**: Waits for result
- **Observation**: Gets back `5.972e24 kg`
- **Thought again**: “Now I multiply it by 3”
- **Action**: `calculate: 5.972e24 * 3`
- ✅ **Answer**: Final result

🔁 This loop enables **true problem-solving**, not just guessing.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

✅ **No black boxes** – you control every part  
✅ **Deep understanding** – you’ll know how agents *really* work  
✅ **Framework-free** – no dependency on LangChain or similar  
✅ **Extensible** – easy to add search, time, or custom tools later  
✅ **Perfect for learning, teaching, or portfolio**  

You're not just using AI.  
You're **reverse-engineering it**.
